# Excel-Projects
This project is a part of the Accenture Data Analytics and Visualisation Virtual Internship hosted by Forage. Link to the internship: https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/hzmoNKtzvAzXsEqx8/Data-Analytics-Virtual-Experience?ref=fTa6aHFS8jPfvMW28

The internship is designed to simulate a real-life data analysis project. It gave a wonderful opportunity to experience as to what it is like to be inside the firm and got an exprience around what they do day-to-day in terms of collecing and capturing data, analyzing that data, and drawing out deep insights to be able to present those to the clients.

Data Source: Excel file containing the data used, has been uploaded.

# Project Overview:
`An analysis of the content categories showing the top 5 categories with the largest popularity`
My task was to analyze the data provided by the client, which contained information about content, reactions and sessions. I used MS Excel to clean, manipulate, and visualize the data. Through this process, I were able to identify key trends and insights, which were used to provide recommendations to the client.

## Modules

1. Data Cleaning & Modeling - Data cleaning and modeling was conducted to ensure that the data provided by the client was accurate and complete. I performed various checks, including verifying the completeness of the data, identifying and removing duplicate entries, and validating the accuracy of the data.

2. Data Visualization & Storytelling - I used different visualisations such as bar chart, pie chart and different charts that presented the data in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand way. Through interactive charts, I facilitated data exploration and empowered users to interactively discover patterns, trends, and outliers within the data. 

3. Presentation - I prepared a powerpoint presentation and skillfully utilized storytelling techniques effectively to communicate key insights and findings to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.  

## Skills gained:
1. Data Understanding 
2. Data Modeling
3. Data Analysis
4. Data Visualisation 
5. Presentation

During my internship, I seized a valuable learning opportunity that equipped me with essential skills. I acquired an in-depth understanding of data interpretation and analysis, enabling me to uncover crucial insights for informed business decisions. Furthermore, I honed my ability to effectively communicate complex information by presenting findings in a clear and concise manner. By ensuring clients comprehended the implications of the data, I facilitated their understanding and recognition of its potential impact. This internship allowed me to develop a strong foundation in data analysis and presentation, providing me with a solid framework to contribute meaningfully to future projects and contribute to data-driven decision-making processes.
