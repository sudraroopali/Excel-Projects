Steps for cleaning the data 

1. Drop the columns that are not useful for analysis 
2. Check if all the rows and columns are clean
"go to data, add the filter to the column names only"
then chek the filter and see if the data is in the same format 
and do find and replace to make sure data is similar 
3. remove any blanks from the data 
4. merge the 3 excel sheets into one using vlookup

going to home -> format -> move and copy
